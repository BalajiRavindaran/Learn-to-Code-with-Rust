// Deref Coercion is a feature in Rust that allows you to automatically convert a reference of one type to a reference of another type, as long as the target type implements the Deref trait. This is particularly useful when working with types like String and &str, where you can pass a String to a function that expects a &str, without needing to explicitly convert it.
// This is because Rust automatically dereferences the String to a &str when needed, making it easier to work with different string types without having to manually convert them every time.

// Rust Deref Coercion converts any array reference or slices to a common type of &[i32] or &[i32; N] where N is the length of the array, so you can pass a slice of an array to a function that expects a slice of i32, without needing to explicitly convert it.
// This is useful when you want to work with a slice of an array without having to worry
// about the specific type of the slice, as long as it is a slice of i32
// or an array of i32 with a known length &[i32, 6].
